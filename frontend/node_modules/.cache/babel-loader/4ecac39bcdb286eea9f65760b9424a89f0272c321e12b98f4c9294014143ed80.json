Over the last year, as the pandemic ripped across the country and world, we\\u2019ve talked about testing openly and frankly \\u2014 with our friends, families, social networks (even our mirrors or pets, if we\\u2019re honest). \\u201CGreetings from the monthly spitshow!\\u201D a pal of mine recently captioned an Instagram post outside a COVID-19 testing center. \\u201CHope folks are still getting tested regularly!\\u201D We know how often NFL players are getting tested; we\\u2019ve seen celebs photographed swabbing their nostrils.

Sara C. Flowers, vice president of education at Planned Parenthood, says she\\u2019s noticed it, too. In fact, like other experts in her field, she picked up on parallels between coronavirus and sexual health in the earliest stages of the pandemic. \\u201CSex educators around the country were all looking at each other through our Zoom screens like, \\u2018Let us help you! Bring us into the conversation!\\u2019\\u201D Flowers laughs. It\\u2019s not just testing. The similarities between sexual wellness and COVID-19 safety include everything from barrier methods (condoms aren\\u2019t a perfect analogy for masks, but they are close) to reducing stigma around infection to the simple importance of prioritizing your health and the health of people around you. Flowers remembers seeing stickers early on in the pandemic reading, \\u201CMy mask protects you and your mask protects me,\\u201D something sex educators have been saying about condoms for decades. \\u201COne thing that COVID and STIs have in common is that you can have the infection with no apparent symptoms at all,\\u201D Loh explains to The News Station. Studies have shown that up to 50% of people who test positive for COVID have no symptoms \\u2014 not unlike, say, chlamydia, which is sometimes called \\u201Cthe silent infection.\\u201D \\u201CIt\\u2019s almost normalizing people to the idea that they should get tested, even if they have no apparent symptoms,\\u201D Loh says. \\u201CIn my practice, that\\u2019s where I can really talk about how this helps promote a safer and healthier sex life for everyone.\\u201D An even deeper COVID-related cultural shift is that we now talk about public health all the time. It dominates the news, conversations with family, and the decisions we make in our personal lives (including the decision many made to not have a personal life for the past year). People are taking a closer account of things like symptoms, exposure, and risk, and they\\u2019re asking themselves: \\u201CDo I need to get tested if X?\\u201D At the same time, we\\u2019ve had to develop and exercise communication skills \\u2014 and perhaps more importantly, boundary-setting skills \\u2014 with the people we know and care about. Flowers says it\\u2019s given people language and familiarity with asking questions that might have been uncomfortable before: Where have you been? Who have you been with? What did you all do? Was it indoors or outdoors? Who was masked? Who was not? Where had they been? In New York, where Loh practices, the state Department of Health released guidelines for safer sex during the pandemic, which \\u2014 in addition to the usual tips about condoms and consent \\u2014 noted that if you were planning to hook up with or see someone, you should be asking them about the symptoms of COVID and their COVID status. That was really powerful to me, especially, because these are the kind of conversations that our patients \\u2014 any sexually active individual \\u2014 should be having with their partner or partners,\\u201D Loh says. \\u201CHaving that open dialogue really can help people develop a trusting relationship with their sexual partners.\\u201D \\u201CWe\\u2019ve really seen folks talking about if they wanted to put protocols in place to see loved ones or to see friends,\\u201D Flowers tells The News Station. And when it comes to bodily autonomy and safe sex, \\u201CThese are the building blocks, right? I think the opportunity is for folks to take these skill that they\\u2019ve developed in this pandemic and think about, \\u2018OK, they\\u2019re not going to just go flat and stop being useful as vaccines roll out and some restrictions are lifted.\\u2019\\u201D The question now becomes, as Flowers says: \\u201CHow do we use this skill set we\\u2019ve developed to continue to keep ourselves healthy as life continues to evolve?\\u201D That part\\u2019s a bit trickier. \\u201CThese are all theoreticals,\\u201D Michael P. Angarone, who leads the Northwestern Medicine STD clinic, tells The News Station before adding, \\u201CI do think there is a link there.\\u201D Angarone points to the early twenty-teens when medical experts were pushing to stop target and risk-factor testing for HIV, telling people instead \\u2014 hey, you\\u2019re single, you\\u2019ve been sexually active, we\\u2019re going to test you for HIV every year unless you don\\u2019t want us to. The practice increased the number of people getting tested, and, Angarone says, truly changed the way we look at HIV, allowing physicians to identify many people as HIV positive who might not have known until they came in presenting AIDS. HIV testing is now opt-out, under the recommendation of the CDC. And with coronavirus, in many states, you can walk into a Walgreens or a CVS or a county testing center, spit in a tube or get your nose swabbed, and have results in hand a few days later \\u2014 free of charge, regardless of whether or not you have insurance. \\u201CNow, what is that going to take for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, HPV? I don\\u2019t really know,\\u201D Angarone says. With most other STDs, you have to seek out a clinic or tell your provider you want to be tested. That can be a barrier and is one of the things keeping people from getting tested, even if they should. So, too, is stigma. (It\\u2019s why many health practitioners use STIs instead of STDs \\u2014 studies have shown that infection is a less stigmatized, less negative term than disease.) Loh wonders if there\\u2019s an opportunity to pull from the pandemic, which \\u201Chas normalized the term \\u2018testing\\u2019 overall, to where people are almost thinking about all forms \\u2014 beyond even STIs \\u2014 in a way that maybe they haven\\u2019t before.\\u201D Flowers is optimistic, if realistic, about the possibility for COVID to revolutionize sexual health. The world can change. People used to smoke on airplanes. There was a time when drivers were up in arms about having to put on seat belts. \\u201CDo you know anyone who gets in a car right now and doesn\\u2019t wear a seat belt?\\u201D Flowers asks.
