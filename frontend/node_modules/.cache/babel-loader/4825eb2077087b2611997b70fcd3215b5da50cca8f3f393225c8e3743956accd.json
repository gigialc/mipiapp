But when parents “dramatize” sexuality, try to control their teen’s sexual behavior, and close the doors to open communication about sex, their teens are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors.\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\" sx={{ marginBottom: '16px' }}>\n        A recent study by Nicole Ja, a senior research analyst at Applied Survey Research who completed her graduate work in developmental and child psychology at Cornell University, found this “dramatization” was exacerbated for low-income and ethnic or racial minority parents in New York state due to fears about their children’s health and safety and lack of resources and educational tools.\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\" sx={{ marginBottom: '16px' }}>\n        “American parents, regardless of their ethnic, racial or socioeconomic background, seem to approach teen sexuality by asserting control over children, remaining skeptical of youths’ capacity to experience love and handle strong emotions as part of intimate relationships, and being extremely uncomfortable in facing children’s interest in, questions about, or engagement in sex,” Ja said. “However, parents in our study also face the additional challenges of elevated dangers to children’s health and safety; a lack of trusted, high-quality safety nets and services; having to cope with their own trauma; and a lack of role models for themselves and their children. And for the many grandparents raising grandchildren, there is a generational distance that includes lacking a common language to talk about sex.”\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\" sx={{ marginBottom: '16px' }}>\n        It makes sense that parents who participated in the study \"dramatized\" their teen’s sexuality, Ja said, because coming of age for their children is more perilous compared to affluent American families, and certainly compared to families in the Netherlands, where policies and practices provide greater protection of human rights. However, the parents in the study were able to identify communication skills and community resources to help them discuss sexuality with their teenage children.\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\" sx={{ marginBottom: '16px' }}>\n        “This includes wanting to develop communication skills to assist in the process of balancing support with the setting of firm boundaries, modeling and talking with teens about building and sustaining healthy intimate relationships, and reducing shame in talking about sex,” Ja said. “Thus, parents showed great intentionality as they strive towards ‘normalizing’ sexual development.”\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\" sx={{ marginBottom: '16px' }}>\n        This finding mirrors a larger body of research that demonstrates that teaching parents how to communicate with their children about sex is effective. Studies show that interventions improve the frequency and content of discussions about sex between parents and their children.\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\" sx={{ marginBottom: '16px' }}>\n        The take-home message: Parents who have open, honest conversations with their children about sex, and who view sexual development as a normal part of adolescent development, play the most crucial role in their children’s health and well-being. Discussions about sex should be an ongoing process, not a one-time “talk.”\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\" sx={{ marginBottom: '16px' }}>\n        Source:
